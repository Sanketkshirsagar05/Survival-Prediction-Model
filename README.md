Overview
This project aims to predict survival probabilities in specific scenarios (e.g., Titanic disaster) using machine learning models. It leverages various classification algorithms and explores their performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Key features of the dataset (e.g., age, gender, class) significantly influence predictions.
